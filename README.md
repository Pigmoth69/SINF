##Technology

###Vision Statement

**Vision:** Create a generation of leaders able to  improve their community and to further develop themselves. 

**Mission:** From youth to youth foster an “I want to, I can, it, I do it!” attitude, by inspiring and supporting high school students to be drivers of the implementation of their own ideas and their learning.
From youth to youth, we are creating a generation of impact citizens and serving leaders. We work with high school students creating a Mentes Empreendedoras Club, offering 7 presential workshops, long distance weekly mentoring facilitated by a mentor of our team or a Fellow. The Mentes Empreendedoras Fellows programme is an opportunity to develop our alumni, university students and young executives’ leadership and skills while leveraging the talent of high school students.

###Short Description

Mentes Empreendedoras is a system and it includes the Mentes Empreendedoras Cycle, Leadership Fellows Program and the Inspire Your Teacher campaign. Also we are present from North to the South of Portugal and served 330 students the Mentes Empreendedoras Cycle and 1300 students with Inspire your Teacher. We envision technology as a mean to help young Mentes Empreendedoras a) structure their ideas, b) learn more about other projects done in the past or in a different locations and c) access an interactive and inspiring channel, fuelled with content created by us or our participants, to boost motivation, knowledge and project success. 
Technology can also leverage our impact by making our youth movement more interconnected and impactful. Also with Inspire Your Teacher we have a lot of materials such as pictures and videos we want to share with the students and the rest of the world. Our goal is to grow our campaign from 1.300 students last February to 6.300 next February.
It should be an app that anyone can manage event someone who don’t understand much about technologies. So it should be cool and easy.

###Expected Results

Depending on the recommendation, we would like to have an application or a platform for the computer and the mobile phones.
The app should be ready to share all the information above as the students’ projects/works and help the communication between them.

###Social Impact

**Expected Results**
- impact potential: low, moderate, high; Connecting young people and fosters exchange of experiences will increase motivation and therefore project quality, success rate and impact. Moreover it will enable us to collect data in a more effective and simple way in order to learn faster and improve our work. For Inspire your Teacher a platform is essential to share content such as videos, letters and posters to inspire teachers and be shared with friends, parents and community.
- ways of change: situations, well-being, behaviour, attitudes and feelings, skills and abilities, awareness and knowledge, relationships; Connectivity and project sharing, from our offline experience, inspired youth to change their attitudes being more resilient and driven. They will be more aware and know more about that subjects and they will improve their skills and abilities. All of this will change their relationships as well.
- level of impact: individual, family, community, organisation, society; Working with high school students and their teachers with projects for the community impact first those directly involved, second their partners such as Municipalities and their beneficiaries such retired people or primary school students participating in a bullying prevention programme. This example track record and testimony follows them home so it impact also their families. The same will happen with their community and society as they become the role model. 
- territorial scope: local, regional, national, international; We have been all around the country and we are working to expand internationally.
- type of innovation: resources optimisation, better solutions,  disruptive/new solutions; This app will be a new solution to share the information and the projects at the same time the students keep in touch so we will have a optimisation of the resources as we can have all in one.
- value proposition:
Through Mentes Empreendedoras Clubs in High Schools, we create a “Virtuous Cycle” that activates young people’s social impact potential making them inspiring role models for themselves and their community.
Through Inspire Your Teacher we positive reinforce the teachers’ role, by creating awareness among students who develop content with inspirational messages and spread the word to their family and friends
- and sustainability model: 
Our model is cost efficient and right impact. The Mentes Empreendedoras Cycle is being sold to For the “Mentes Empreendedoras” cycle we have a defined cost and it can be sell to anyone (it’s flexible) and out participation should be temporary so the schools will be in charge and autonomous.
We sell the Fellows program to business companies that allow us to have a social business.
Inspire your teacher is supported by education foundations and sells publicity 
- growth potential: replicable and scalable. The All our three services are being scaled up by ourselves and though partnerships so they are all highly scalable. We believe that technology will enable and accelerate this process.
